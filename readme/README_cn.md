## Camera AI Notifications
Supported cameras create an `AI Detection` event entity, such as `event.front_camera_ai_detection`. Use this `event.*` entity for notification automations, and replace the sample entity ID with the actual entity ID shown in your Home Assistant instance.

AI detections are one-time events, not on/off states. Trigger on them with Home Assistant's `event.received` trigger and filter by `event_type`. Supported event types include `person`, `pet`, `vehicle`, `vehicle_enter`, `vehicle_out`, `vehicle_held_up`, `package`, `package_drop_off`, `package_pick_up`, `package_exist`, `other`, and `ai_detection`. The `ai_detection` event type is used when one camera notification contains more than one detected object.

Example automation:

```yaml
alias: "Notify when X-Sense detects a person"
triggers:
  - trigger: event.received
    target:
      entity_id: event.front_camera_ai_detection
    options:
      event_type:
        - person
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      message: "X-Sense camera detected a person."
```

Use the `Last AI Detection` sensor and related last-detection timestamp sensors only for last-known history, dashboards, or conditions. These sensors can be unknown until the first notification arrives and are not the main notification trigger.
