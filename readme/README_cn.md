## Camera AI Notifications
Supported cameras create an `AI Detection` event entity, such as `event.front_camera_ai_detection`. Use this `event.*` entity for notification automations, and replace the sample entity ID with the actual entity ID shown in your Home Assistant instance.

The easiest UI path is the included blueprint. Use the button below to import it, select the camera `AI Detection` event entity, leave Detection types selected to notify for every AI event, then keep or replace the default notification action.

[![Import Blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FJarnsen%2Fha-xsense-component_test%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fxsense%2Fcamera_ai_notification.yaml)

AI detections are one-time events, not on/off states. Trigger on them with Home Assistant's `event.received` trigger and filter by `event_type`. Supported event types include `person`, `pet`, `vehicle`, `vehicle_enter`, `vehicle_out`, `vehicle_held_up`, `package`, `package_drop_off`, `package_pick_up`, `package_exist`, `other`, and `ai_detection`. The `ai_detection` event type is used when one camera notification contains more than one detected object.

Example automation:

```yaml
alias: "Notify when X-Sense detects a person"
triggers:
  - trigger: event.received
    target:
      entity_id: event.front_camera_ai_detection
    options:
      event_type:
        - person
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      message: "X-Sense camera detected a person."
```

Use the `Last AI Detection` sensor and related last-detection timestamp sensors only for last-known history, dashboards, or conditions. These sensors can be unknown until the first notification arrives and are not the main notification trigger.
